 How to Activate Your Card
----------------------------

Most cards are already activated at the time of purchase, but if yours isn’t:

- Go to https://www.vanillagift.com
- Click **“Sign In”** or **“Register Card”**
- Enter your **card number**, **expiry date**, and **CVV** (found on the back)
- Hit submit — and you’re ready to shop online or in-store!

 How to Check Your Balance

 Can You Transfer the Balance?
-------------------------------

**Short answer:** Not directly. You can’t transfer funds to a bank, PayPal, or another card. However, you *can*:

- Link the card to **payment apps** at checkout (where supported)
- Use **split payments** at certain stores (part card, part another method)
- Spend the full balance online or in-store wherever **Visa or Mastercard** is accepted

.. tip::
   Always ensure your purchase total (including tax) is less than or equal to your available balance.

 What If the Card Expires?
---------------------------

Don’t worry — you might still be able to use your remaining balance:

- Check the **expiration date** printed on the card
- Visit the **balance check site** to see if funds remain
- Contact **Vanilla’s customer support** to request a replacement card *(fees may apply)*
